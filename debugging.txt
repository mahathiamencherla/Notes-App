step 1
console.log everything

step 2 - debugger

"debugger" - add this at the point you want to debug
in terminal run code as: node inspect app.js ....(blah blah)
..goes down to a debug terminal 
go to chrome and then type: chrome://inspect
go to configure (discover network targets)
make sure 127.0.0.1:9229 and localhost(9229) are there
now click inspect and youll go to the debug tool

click that play button in the right hand side and itll run till "debugger"
and you can click play again itll continue till the end or till it finds debugger


if you wanna shut this... go to the original terminal and type ctrl+C twice
